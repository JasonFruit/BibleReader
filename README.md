BibleReader
============================================

A Python/Qt interface to several Bible web APIs.  Right now, it can connect to three:

 - [The ESV API](http://esvapi.org)
 - [The NET API](http://labs.bible.org/api_web_service)
 - [The Ephesians 4:14 API](http://www.4-14.org.uk/xml-bible-web-service-api)

More may be added.  An interface to `libsword` using the `diatheke` command-line tool is also planned.

Note: this application is under initial, pre-release development, and
is not really ready for public use.  Though it works fairly well,
copyright notices and source attributions have not yet been
implemented in accordance with licensing for the various versions;
please don't use it until that is resolved.
